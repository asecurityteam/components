## Overview

This is a collection of commonly used components for our projects. They are
designed to work with [`settings`](https://github.com/asecurityteam/settings)
and are intended to be embedded within other projects.

<a id="markdown-quick-start" name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

```golang
package main

import (
    "context"

    "github.com/asecurityteam/components"
    "github.com/asecurityteam/settings"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    envSource := settings.NewEnvSource(os.Environ())

    p := components.NewProducer(ctx, envSource)
    tr := components.NewHTTP(ctx, envSource)

    c := &http.Client{
        Transport: tr,
    }
}
```
